_polarchart_ is a Python package which allows to easily create
a series of polar charts including radar charts (radar plots),
star charts (star plots), and spider charts (spider plots)
for multivariate data analysis.


An example:

```{python}
from polarchart import load_mtcars, radar

# Loading data set shipped with the package; pandas DataFrame
mt = load_mtcars()
mt.head(n = 2)

# Creating radar chart
radar(mt, scale = True, title = "Demo figure", figsize = (10, 8))
```
