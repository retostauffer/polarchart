# Creating radar charts, star charts, and spider charts in Python

TODO(R): Modify once in an alpha state.

So far the package can be installed via:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/retostauffer/polarchart
```

The releases on [test PyPi](https://test.pypi.org/project/polarchart/)
and [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/polarchart/) are no real releases
and have just been made to claim the name.
